title: About
---

I am a 24 year old software developer interested in Buddhist philosophy, personality science, 
medieval India and Europe and Urdu poetry among other things. I care about the environment 
and am interested in living sustainably by consuming less and adopting minimalism in everyday living.

I will use this blog to write reviews of books I've recently read, to curate good poetry, 
films, music and comedy or as an outlet for my thoughts.
