# Haxell

This is a blog powered by Hakyll and GitHub pages. After trying and facing hiccups in trying to serve a static website from Amazon s3, I took the easy way out and used GitHub pages instead. 

In my experieince, setting up CI/CD is slightly less straightforward compared to Jekyll. I followed [this](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/tutorials/github-pages-tutorial.html) guide step by step. It helps that this was written by the creator of Hakyll.
